# Copy Doctor

Review and improve marketing/UI copy using Ogilvy principles.

## Core Principles

1. **Benefit-driven**: Lead with what the user gets, not what the product does
2. **Specific**: Replace vague claims with concrete details
3. **Clear**: Simple words, short sentences, no jargon
4. **Active voice**: Subject does the action

## What to Review

- Headlines and subheads
- Taglines
- CTAs (calls to action)
- Button text
- Microcopy (form labels, tooltips, error messages)
- Landing page copy
- Product UI text
- Marketing emails

## Review Framework

For each piece of copy, evaluate:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Benefit | Does it answer "what's in it for me?" |
| Specificity | Are there concrete numbers, outcomes, or details? |
| Clarity | Can a 12-year-old understand it? |
| Voice | Is it active, not passive? |
| Length | Is every word earning its place? |
| Action | Is the next step obvious? |

## Common Fixes

### Weak → Strong Patterns

| Problem | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Feature, not benefit | "AI-powered analytics" | "See what's working in seconds" |
| Vague | "Improve your workflow" | "Save 4 hours per week" |
| Passive | "Reports are generated" | "Generate reports" |
| Too long | "Click here to get started now" | "Get started" |
| Unclear action | "Learn more" | "See pricing" or "Watch demo" |

### Button Text Rules

- Use verbs: "Get", "Start", "Try", "Download"
- Be specific: "Download PDF" beats "Download"
- Match user intent: "Continue shopping" vs "Keep browsing"
- Avoid: "Submit", "Click here", "Learn more" (unless truly exploratory)

### Headline Rules

- Lead with the outcome
- Use numbers when possible
- Keep under 10 words
- Test: Would someone share this?

## Output Format

When reviewing copy:

1. **Current**: Quote the existing copy
2. **Issues**: List specific problems (1-3 bullets)
3. **Rewrite**: Provide improved version
4. **Why**: One sentence explaining the improvement

When writing new copy:

1. **Ask**: What's the user's goal? What action should they take?
2. **Draft**: 2-3 options from different angles
3. **Recommend**: Pick one and explain why

## Ogilvy Maxims

Reference these when explaining improvements:

- "The headline is the most important element. Five times as many people read headlines as body copy."
- "Never use tricky or irrelevant headlines."
- "The more you tell, the more you sell." (for long-form, not UI)
- "Write the way you talk. Naturally."
- "Don't address your readers as though they were gathered together in a stadium."
